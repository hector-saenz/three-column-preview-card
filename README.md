## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How not to overcomplicate my code was one of the main lessons that I learned while I was doing this project. Improving my skills at CSS was extremely valuable for me because sometimes I tend to complicate my CSS with specificity problems, generic class names and a desorganized structure.

### Continued development

The CSS code written is not perfect. I know there is room for improvement and I will be focusing on writing cleaner code for future projects.
